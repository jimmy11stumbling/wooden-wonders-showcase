Here’s an optimized prompt to guide the language model effectively in creating fully functional and production-ready websites:

---

**Prompt for Language Model**:

"Design a complete website with the following requirements:  

1. **Fully Functional Components**:
   - Ensure all links, buttons, and windows are operational. For example, links must navigate to the correct pages or perform the intended actions without errors.  
   - Buttons should have clear hover states and accessible labeling (e.g., ARIA labels) to enhance usability.

2. **Production Quality Standards**:
   - Implement responsive design for optimal performance on all device types (mobile, tablet, desktop).  
   - Adhere to web development best practices, including clean and well-documented code.

3. **Detailed Design Features**:
   - Use consistent and visually appealing design elements, including brand-specific colors, fonts, and animations.  
   - Buttons and links should feature interactive feedback, such as hover effects and active states.  
   - Incorporate clear calls-to-action to improve user engagement.

4. **Accessibility**:
   - Ensure compliance with accessibility standards such as WCAG 2.1.  
   - Include keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility for all interactive elements.

5. **Error Handling and Validation**:
   - Test all links and buttons to ensure there are no broken links or functionality issues.  
   - Add error messages for invalid inputs where forms are used.

6. **Customization and Feedback**:
   - Allow customization of content (e.g., text, images) for scalability.  
   - Provide a summary or code snippets for review at each stage of development to ensure alignment with requirements.

7. **Specific Needs**:
   - [Include your specific requirements, such as features, components, or integrations (e.g., Google Maps for locations, dynamic forms, etc.)].
